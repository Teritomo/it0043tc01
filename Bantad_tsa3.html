          For those who are not currently aware of our existence, we represent the organization known as the SCP Foundation. 
            <br>Our previous mission centered around the Containment and study of anamalous objects, entities and other assorted phenomena.
            <br>This mission was the focus of our organization for more than one-hundred years.
        </p>

        <p>
            Due to circumstances outsode of our control, this directive has now changed.
            <br>Our new mission is to create genetically modified Unknown entities.
